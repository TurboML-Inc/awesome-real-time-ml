## What even is "real-time" Machine Learning?

Real-time Machine Learning (ML) delivers predictions and adapts models with extremely low latency, using fresh, continuously streaming data. It employs online or continual learning to instantly update models with new information, ensuring the most relevant insights for immediate actions. This dynamic approach contrasts with batch processing and is crucial for applications requiring instant responsiveness to changing patterns.

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Model outputs generated on-demand as data arrives with extremely low latency.
- **Real-Time Features**: Input attributes derived from real-time, rapidly changing data, processed quickly.
- **Real-Time Learning**: Continuous model updating (online or continual learning) using new data for adaptation and improvement of model performance over time.

## Traditional ML vs Real-Time ML

| Aspect | Traditional ML | Real-Time ML |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **Data Processing** | Processes static, historical datasets in batches. | Continuously ingests and processes streaming data in real-time. |
| **Model Training** | Models are trained offline using complete datasets. | Models are updated incrementally as new data arrives, often using online learning algorithms. |
| **Latency** | Can tolerate higher latency in processing and predictions. | Requires low-latency processing and near-instantaneous predictions. |
| **Scalability** | Typically scales vertically with more powerful hardware. Horizontal scaling is possible with distributed frameworks. | Often requires horizontal scalability to handle high-volume data streams. |
| **Infrastructure** | Can run on standard computing resources. | Often requires specialized streaming infrastructure like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink. |
| **Adaptability** | Models are less adaptive to changing patterns without manual retraining. | Models can adapt to concept drift and evolving patterns in real-time. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Features are often engineered manually and in advance. | Features may be generated on-the-fly or use automated feature extraction techniques. |
| **Model Deployment** | Models are deployed as static versions, updated periodically. | Models are continuously updated and deployed in a streaming fashion. |
| **Use Cases** | Effective for predictive analytics, segmentation, and batch or streaming data predictions. | Ideal for fraud detection, real-time bidding, and personalized recommendations. |
| **Data Volume** | Can work effectively with smaller datasets. | Typically requires larger volumes of data for accurate real-time predictions. |
| **Computational Resources** | Generally less computationally intensive. | Optimizes computational resource usage by processing data incrementally, reducing the need for reprocessing entire datasets, but may require consistent resource availability for real-time updates. |
| **Monitoring** | Periodic model performance checks are usually sufficient unless operating in dynamic environments. | Requires continuous monitoring of model performance and data quality. |
| **Feedback Loop** | Feedback is incorporated in batch updates. | Immediate feedback integration for rapid model adjustments. |
| **Complexity** | Generally simpler to implement and maintain. | More complex, requiring specialized knowledge in streaming architectures and online learning algorithms. |
| **Time-to-Insight** | Longer time from data collection to actionable insights. | Near-immediate insights from incoming data streams. |
